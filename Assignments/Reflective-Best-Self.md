# Reflected Best Self

> This activity is adapted off of resources from University of Michigan.

## Step 1: Identify Respondents & Request Feedback on Your Strengths

Only solicit feedback from those who know you best -- classmates, family, friends, and teachers. This can be done effectively using electronic communication, whereby results can be easily copied and pasted into a table for analysis. Ask these individuals to provide information about your strengths, only, including specific examples of ways in which you used these strengths that were meaningful to them. You may be uncomfortable asking exclusively for positive feedback, but remember that the exercise will help you improve your performance.

Remember this is strengths for you as a person, not exclusively as a software engineer. There may (and most likely will) be overlap though. A great software engineer will draw from qualities that make them a great person.

## Step 2: Recognize Patterns

Use the feedback from respondents to identify common themes or areas of strength. Add examples of your own and organize the information into a table following the general format of the following example illustration. Please use your own themes from the feedback that you receive.

This analysis step can be very insightful. It will help you develop a larger picture of your capabilities and an opportunity to evaluate or reevaluate your skills.

| Debugger champ   | Jessica said, "I had a bug in my python homework that I spent 1 hour to solve and couldn't figure it out. You sat wiht me and we spent a whole other hour and a half to figure it out. I wanted to go to bed but you insisted that we figure out the issue. We finally found it - after doing a bunch of searching through StackOverflow. I was super grateful for your help." |        I persist and don't give up easily |

## Step 3: Compose Your Best-Self Portrait

Write a description of yourself that summarizes what the analysis revealed, weaving the themes from the feedback and your own observations into a composite of your “personal best.”

It should be a prose composition approximately three paragraphs long.

Please begin the first paragraph with the statement _“When I am at my best, I…”_

This will take time and careful consideration but should provide an image of who you are now --- and who you can become.

## Step 4: Reflect

What has your best-self portrait revealed about the career path you are on or would like to define?

Submit your reflection on [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/351975/assignments/1894066).

Your instructor will provide individidualized feedback based on your submission before final grades are submitted.
