| 1️⃣ &nbsp;&nbsp;**Compare and contrast design patterns common to many software development disciplines.**                |                             Unable to name or describe any design pattern or their use cases.                              |     Can name and describe at least two common design patterns. <br><br>Completed both design pattern assignments in class.      |                  Can name 3 or more design patterns. <br><br>Applies design patterns in multiple public projects.                   |
| 2️⃣ &nbsp;&nbsp;**Produce elegant pseudocode to quickly describe how to solve a problem.**                               | Experiences difficulty expressing programming thoughts in psuedocode. <br><br>Produces inaccurate or incomplete solutions. |                Expresses programming thoughts step-by-step. <br><br>Pseudocode is readable by programmers only.                 |         Fluent expression of programming thought; details each step without using syntax or other programming terminology.          |
| 3️⃣ &nbsp;&nbsp;**Design and implement code refactoring techniques to improve readability, quality, and craftsmanship.** |                                        Completed 10 or less refactoring excercises.                                        |                                          Completed all assigned refactoring exercies.                                           |                              Applied refactoring techniques learned in class to at least one project.                               |
| 4️⃣ &nbsp;&nbsp;**Apply debugging and unit testing best practices to improve quality assurance.**                        |         Did not complete debugging or unit testing labs. <br><br>Unable to run an interactive debugger in any IDE.         | Usually debugs via print statements; leverages interactive debugging features rarely. <br><br>Some projects include unit tests. |       Uses an interactive debugger at several times a week to diagnose code conditions. <br>Most projects include unit tests.       |
| 5️⃣ &nbsp;&nbsp;**Write and modify code faster using common IDE features and shortcut keys.**                            |                                    Uses only the mouse when working in an IDE or shell.                                    |                              Uses a combination of keyboard shortcuts and a mouse when developing.                              | Uses only keyboard shortcuts when developing. <br><br>Creates custom keyboard chords, macros, and snippets in order to code faster. |
