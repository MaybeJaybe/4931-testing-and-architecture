    # The dictionary carries too much info and is hard to read 
    # so we would suggest creating a food class where you can initialize it with 
    # the foodâ€™s name, prep time, is_veggie, food_type, cuisine, (ingredients?) and recipe
    # Our group would create a class named Recipe. 
    # It would have attributes including recipe_name, prep_time, is_veggie, food_type, cuisine, ingredients (a list), and instructions. 
    # Each print statement would be a method of the class
    # Create a new class for the foods and move the print statements into class methods
